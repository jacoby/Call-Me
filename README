call_me.pl is a script that you use to call a phone via computer.

Issues:
    * You need a Twilio account, and you probably want to buy a number
      rather than memorize your eight-digit access code to the sandbox
      number.
    * You cannot call just any number. You need to register that number
      with Twilio before it lets you call them. This makes it a call-me
      or call-someone-I-know tool rather than a general-purpose tool
      for calling, which is probably good.
    * This version has the number to call written into the config file.
      If you want to call several people, fork this and make it your 
      own.
    * You instigate the call in a different place and way than where
      you define how the call works. I include echo.php, which simply 
      takes the variable "message" from the query string and puts it 
      into the center of a TwiML document.
    * I use the option for a female voice. Here's why:
